# Git Challenges Starter Repo (with Data & Expected Outputs)

This repository contains four small, self-contained programming challenges.
Each challenge folder includes:
- `problem.md`: the student-facing description
- `starter.py`: buggy/incomplete starter code
- `data/`: sample input files
- `expected/`: reference outputs for grading & self-check

## Getting Started (Students)
1. Clone this starter repository.
2. Create **your own remote repository** (GitHub).
3. Add your remote and push your work there.
4. Work on your assigned challenge, committing in small, meaningful steps.
5. Push your changes to your **own** remote; submit your repo URL + reflection.

See `ASSIGNMENT.md` for the workflow and grading ideas, and `tests.md` for
quick checks with the provided data/expected files.
